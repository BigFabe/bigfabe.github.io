# THIS ARTICLE IS WORK IN PROGRESS
A few days ago I held a presentation on sociological theories of action. These include all kinds of theories where an actor is the primary source of interest. The text is by Uwe Schimank, who apparently is inspired by Luhmanns Systemstheory (which I was not aware of until now). 

I laid out an argumentation arc for my presentation. The presentation was supposed to begin with the problem of operational closeness. This concept is (as I think) originated in cybernetics and adopted by Luhmann for social sciences. In Luhmanns theory of systems, operations are the most basic forms of actions of systems. Depending on what you want to observe, sociologist observe communication as the most basic operation of social systems, biologists observe live as the most basic operation of nature, trainers observe sport as a means of building muscles and so on. The clonesness concept on the other hand describes the idea that every operation has to happen *inside* the system. This does have some consequences, for example, that unlike elves in Lord of the Rings, live cant be rented to others. Maybe you can externally introduce energy to a system, for example an artifical lung, but the core operation has to happen inside the system. This is a problem. Since all thinking operations are happening within the brain, and since two brains can not just connect to each other, we have to rely on other means of 'thinking externalisation'. For that humans (and propably other animals, though as I am not a biologist, I do not know if one can generalize it) have created communication. Communication is not perfect. The main problem is that thinking and communicating can diverge. This is a problem in all fields of social life, one could think of a marriage where one partner swears they have not cheated, while the suspicious partner can only rely on external cues, a red face, some stuttering and so on. Another problem is that communications do not have sense by them selfes. Basic forms of communication like talking is in its physical dimension only a vibration of air particles, resulting in electronical stimulations in humans brains. Money as well is just paper with some numbers printet on it. In this manner, sense is something which is outside of humans. Its important for that it makes sense of the environment humans live in, but it is not within humans themselves, it is not individualist, rather it is shared across societies and it can be created and destroyed by actors, ideas and organisations. 

I had a lot of fun creating this presentation since it is so fundamental sociological that you can basically implement all social actions as examples (I even prepared a discussion questions about communication with aliens. With the advances in technology humans send out messages to space. I argued that this is a social action simular to a live streamer who does send messages to the void without knowing who watches). One aspect I liked about my presentation was when i began talking about sense makers and sense thiefes. Under sense makers I subsumed people like Donald Trump, Children and Churches. Under sense thiefes I included Friedrich Merz, Doctors and Nikolaus Kopernikus. The first group supplies societies with sense of the world. When Trump talks about the deep state, he supplies his fans with templates through which the world can be observed. Similar the priest in the church, through whom everything becomes a will of god. I also included the family as I feared that the concept could be seen as somewhat traditionalist or right under a in general more progressive listenership, which it is not. I would argue that children in families play a huge role in supplieng their parents with sense, as obviously the opposite is the case too since children need parents to make sense of the world. The second group on the other hand 'steals' sense from societies. In general I would conclude nature scientists under this group since they oppose a human centrism the church upholded for long times. Nikolaus Kopernikus who replaced the human centred world approach by a sun centred world approach could be seen as its first representative. I also concluded persons like Friedrich Merz. Initially I intendet a little joke as well as wanting to compare him to Trump, but the more I think about it, the difference between Trump and Merz is also a difference between a charismatic and a legal/buroucreatic leadership. The more I think about it I reject a simplistic way of a charismatic leader who can be seen as a sense supplier, while a buroucratic leader can be seen as a sense 'thief'. Persons with a tendency to just manage, like Merkel, can be also seen as sense supplies (I think there are many Germans who do that). Another argument Id like to make, is that persons dont need to be liked to become sense supplies. The war against a shared enemy can for example unite people under shared hostility.
