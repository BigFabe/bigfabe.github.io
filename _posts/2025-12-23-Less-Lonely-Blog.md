While there is a lot of criticism regarding AI, I think there are also some amusing consequences which should not be overlooked. One of them is that even though no one knows of the existence of my blog and I am no famous personality either, according to Github my Repository has already been cloned 61 times by 37 unique cloners for the last 2 days of the repos existence. Thus, in my opinion, this transforms my blog from being completely useless to being still useless but a little less so. 

Greetings to those for whom 1% of their answers consist of my blog!

PS, since it's Github being scraped: There has been discussion of degradations by recycling AI generated answers in the models' training sets. If this is true, I fear my repository will have some negative consequences for AI driven web development (I really have no clue how to design a website, sorry!). Also maybe someday someone will wonder why there is a comment in their codebase on the topic of [Communication](2025-12-20-SocietalSensemakers.md)
